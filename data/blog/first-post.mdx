# Welcome to EpicBlog!

My name is Liem Luttrell and I'm a freshman in high school. I am excited to start this blog and share my projects and interests with all of you.

One of my main focuses on this blog will be my ChessAI project. I have always been fascinated by the game of chess and the potential for artificial intelligence to improve and change the way we play. I will be sharing my progress, challenges, and successes as I work on this project.

I also have a passion for coding and technology in general, so I may also post about other projects and interests in those areas as well.

I hope you enjoy reading EpicBlog and please feel free to leave comments and feedback on my posts. Let's start this journey together!
